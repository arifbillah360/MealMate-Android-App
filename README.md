## MealMate

# Introduction
1.1	Overview
MealMate is an Android-based donation application designed to minimize food wastage and support underprivileged communities. The application connects donors—such as restaurants, event organizers, and households—with organizations or individuals in need. Apart from food, the app also facilitates the donation of other essential items such as clothes, books, and utensils. By integrating modern technology with social responsibility, MealMate aims to foster sustainable practices and reduce the adverse effects of excessive waste on the environment.


# 1.2	Motivation
The motivation behind MealMate arises from the growing problem of food wastage in Bangladesh, particularly in urban areas where large events and restaurants generate significant amounts of unused food. Despite this surplus, millions of people still go hungry every day. Additionally, unmanaged waste contributes to environmental pollution and carbon emissions. The absence of a centralized, convenient platform for donating excess food and other essentials further intensifies the problem. MealMate is designed to address these issues by providing a structured system that encourages donations, reduces waste, and helps underprivileged communities.
# 1.3.1	Problem Statement
Despite the availability of surplus food and essential items, there is no effective system in place to bridge the gap between donors and recipients. As a result, valuable resources are wasted, leading to environmental degradation, while underprivileged communities continue to suffer from hunger and lack of basic necessities.
